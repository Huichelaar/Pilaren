# Pilaren
Homebrew videogame demo for Gameboy Advance (GBA).

If at any point you get stuck or you wish to reboot the game, hold `SELECT + START + R + L`.

# TODO
- Pre-render guide text once we're done with everything else.
- Visual bug when trying to exit after solving 2nd stage, before starting the next (match display is enabled and blends out & in if that makes a difference). Tiles brighten then turn dark immediately.
